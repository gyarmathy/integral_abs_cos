# The integral of |cos x|: a problem with sympy

This small repo showcases a problem with sympy's integral calculation: for the integral of the absolute value of cosine x, it only calculates the correct results for values between 0 and 2*pi.

* [integral_sympy_problem.ipynb](integral_sympy_problem.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook, which presents the above problem, as well as two manual calculations of the definite integral between two values.

* [integral_abs_cos.ggb](integral_abs_cos.ggb) is a GeoGebra file plotting the function |cos x| and primitive functions with and without discontinuities.
